FA associated with major depressive disorder. 23 subjects were classified
into four groups (young & old controls, young early-onset & old late-onset
major depression). A significant reduction was found between young
patients and young controls in interesting region which is spatially
approximate to a target proposed for deep brain stimulation for treatment
resistant depression. No significant differences were found between
older controls and old patients due to a large variance in FA resulting
from brain atrophy. These results suggest that TBSS may be useful
for comparing white matter integrity between clinically relevant

interactions to predict major depressive disorder (MDD) patients’
response to therapy. By taking advantage of fMRI’s high temporal
resolution, we propose to extend this work into the domain of individual
patients. Forty-six never treated MDD patients underwent resting-state
fMRI scanning. The model best fitting the group was then fit to individual
patients. Histogram analysis of individuals’ path coefficients
demonstrate some paths (midanterior cingulate to orbitofrontal) are
Gaussian distributed about the group value while others (midanterior
cingulate to ventromedial prefrontal) are not, potentially indicating
group commonalities and subgroup differences, (respectively).},

low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the BOLD signal. In this
study, we estimate these low-frequency physiological fluctuations, pixel-by-pixel from BOLD timecourse by estimating the impulse responses
of physiological processes, and correct these signal changes. The
correlations between the resting-state fMRI timecourses and 7, and
12 sec delayed respiration volume changes are substantially reduced
by this approach. In the grey matter, the fraction of standard deviation
(SD) in the original timecourse accounted for by physiological fluctuations
was 28.09% for respiration and 12.49% for heart beat. These results
indicate that our method is effective for removing physiology-induced
low frequency fluctuation, which is significant in fMRI data.},
