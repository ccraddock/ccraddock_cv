  abstract = {The entropy correlation coefficient (ECC) is a useful tool for measuring
	statistical dependence between variables. We employed this tool to
	search for pairs of variables that correlated in the chronic fatigue
	syndrome (CFS) Computational Challenge dataset. Highly related variables
	are candidates for data reduction, and novel relationships could
	lead to hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of CFS. METHODS: Data
	for 130 female participants in the Wichita (KS, USA) clinical study
	[1] was coded into numerical values. Metric data was grouped using
	Gaussian mixture models; the number of groups was chosen using Bayesian
	information content. The pair-wise correlation between all variables
	was computed using the ECC. Significance was estimated from 1000
	iterations of a permutation test and a threshold of 0.01 was used
	to identify significantly correlated variables. RESULTS: The five
	dimensions of multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) were all highly
	correlated with each other. Seven Short Form (SF)-36 measures, four
	CFS case-defining symptoms and the Zung self-rating depression scale
	all correlated with all MFI dimensions. No physiological variables
	correlate with more than one MFI dimension. MFI, SF-36, CDC symptom
	inventory, the Zung self-rating depression scale and three Cambridge
	Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) measures are highly
	correlated with CFS disease status. DISCUSSION: Correlations between
	the five dimensions of MFI are expected since they are measured from
	the same instrument. The relationship between MFI and Zung depression
	index has been previously reported. MFI, SF-36, and Centers for Disease
	Control and Prevention (CDC) symptom inventory are used to classify
	CFS; it is not surprising that they are correlated with disease status.
	Only one of the three CANTAB measures that correlate with disease
	status has been previously found, indicating the ECC identifies relationships
	not found with other statistical tools. CONCLUSION: The ECC is a
	useful tool for measuring statistical dependence between variables
	in clinical and laboratory datasets. The ECC needs to be further
	studied to gain a better understanding of its meaning for clinical
	data.},

	in identifying common patterns of change in clinical and gene expression
	data that capture the illness state of subjects with unexplained
	fatigue and nonfatigued control participants. METHODS: Data for 111
	female subjects was examined. A total of 59 indicators, including
	multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), medical outcome Short Form
	36 (SF-36), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) symptom
	inventory and cognitive response described illness. Partial least
	squares (PLS) was used to construct two feature spaces: one describing
	the symptom space from gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear
	cells (PBMC) and one based on 117 clinical variables. Multiplicative
	scatter correction followed by quantile normalization was applied
	for trend removal and range adjustment of microarray data. Microarray
	quality was assessed using mean Pearson correlation between samples.
	Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing criteria served to identify significantly
	expressed probes. RESULTS: A single common trend in 59 symptom constructs
	isolates of nonfatigued subjects from the overall group. This segregation
	is supported by two co-regulation patterns representing 10\% of the
	overall microarray variation. Of the 39 principal contributors, the
	17 probes annotated related to basic cellular processes involved
	in cell signaling, ion transport and immune system function. The
	single most influential gene was sestrin 1 (SESN1), supporting recent
	evidence of oxidative stress involvement in chronic fatigue syndrome
	(CFS). Dominant variables in the clinical feature space described
	heart rate variability (HRV) during sleep. Potassium and free thyroxine
	(T4) also figure prominently. CONCLUSION: Combining multiple symptom,
	gene or clinical variables into composite features provides better
	discrimination of the illness state than even the most influential
	variable used alone. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, results
	suggest a common link between oxidative stress, immune system dysfunction
	and potassium imbalance in CFS patients leading to impaired sympatho-vagal
	balance strongly reflected in abnormal HRV.},

  abstract = {Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) frequently complain of
	cognitive dysfunction. However, evidence of cognitive impairment
	in CFS patients has been found in some, but not other, studies. This
	heterogeneity in findings may stem from the relative presence of
	mental fatigue in the patient populations examined. The present study
	assessed this possibility in a population-based sample of CFS patients.
	In all, 43 patients with CFS defined by the criteria of the 1994
	research case definition using measurements recommended by the 2003
	International CFS Study Group, and 53 age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched
	nonfatigued subjects were included in the study. Mental fatigue was
	assessed using the mental fatigue subscale of the multidimensional
	fatigue inventory. Cognitive function was evaluated using an automated
	battery of computerized tests (Cambridge neuropsychological test
	automated battery (CANTAB)) that assessed psychomotor function, planning
	and problem-solving abilities, and memory and attentional performance.
	CFS patients with significant complaints of mental fatigue (score
	of mental fatigue 2 standard deviations above the mean of nonfatigued
	subjects) exhibited significant impairment in the spatial working
	memory and sustained attention (rapid visual information processing)
	tasks when compared to CFS patients with low complaints of mental
	fatigue and nonfatigued subjects. In CFS patients with significant
	mental fatigue, sustained attention performance was impaired only
	in the final stages of the test, indicating greater cognitive fatigability
	in these patients. CFS patients with low mental fatigue displayed
	performance comparable to nonfatigued subjects on all tests of the
	CANTAB battery. These findings show strong concordance between subjective
	complaints of mental fatigue and objective measurement of cognitive
	impairment in CFS patients and suggest that mental fatigue is an
	important component of CFS-related cognitive dysfunction.},

	supports the use of phenotypic measures of chronic fatigue syndrome

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A preliminary report in six patients suggested that deep
	brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG)
	may provide benefit in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). We now
	report the results of these and an additional 14 patients with extended
	follow-up. METHODS: Twenty patients with TRD underwent serial assessments
	before and after SCG DBS. We determined the percentage of patients
	who achieved a response (50\% or greater reduction in the 17-item
	Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD-17]) or remission (scores
	of 7 or less) after surgery. We also examined changes in brain metabolism
	associated with DBS, using positron emission tomography. RESULTS:
	There were both early and progressive benefits to DBS. One month
	after surgery, 35\% of patients met criteria for response with 10\%
	of patients in remission. Six months after surgery, 60\% of patients
	were responders and 35\% met criteria for remission, benefits that
	were largely maintained at 12 months. Deep brain stimulation therapy
	was associated with specific changes in the metabolic activity localized
	to cortical and limbic circuits implicated in the pathogenesis of
	depression. The number of serious adverse effects was small with
	no patient experiencing permanent deficits. CONCLUSIONS: This study
	suggests that DBS is relatively safe and provides significant improvement
	in patients with TRD. Subcallosal cingulate gyrus DBS likely acts
	by modulating brain networks whose dysfunction leads to depression.
	The procedure is well tolerated and benefits are sustained for at
	least 1 year. A careful double-blind appraisal is required before
	the procedure can be recommended for use on a wider scale.},

   Abstract={Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data 
       frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have 
       relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these 
       ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies 
       has yet to be established. This article introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI 
       atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of 
       homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs 
       as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability
       of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, 
       Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The 
       evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce 
       FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random 
       parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence 
       the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for FC 
       analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic 
       homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher 
       numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel 
       scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting 
       atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available at:

    ABSTRACT={Graph theoretical explorations of functional interactions within
              the human connectome, are rapidly advancing our understanding of brain
              architecture. In particular, global and regional topological parameters are
              increasingly being employed to quantify and characterize inter-individual
              differences in human brain function. Head motion remains a significant
              concern in the accurate determination of resting-state fMRI based
              assessments of the connectome, including those based on graph theoretical
              analysis (e.g., motion can increase local efficiency, while decreasing
              global efficiency and small-worldness). This study provides a comprehensive
              examination of motion correction strategies on the relationship between
              motion and commonly used topological parameters. At the individual-level,
              we evaluated different models of head motion regression and scrubbing, as
              well as the potential benefits of using partial correlation (estimated via
              graphical lasso) instead of full correlation. At the group-level, we
              investigated the utility of regression of motion and mean intrinsic
              functional connectivity before topological parameters calculation and/or
              after. Consistent with prior findings, none of the explicit
              motion-correction approaches at individual-level were able to remove motion
              relationships for topological parameters. Global signal regression (GSR)
              emerged as an effective means of mitigating relationships between motion
              and topological parameters; though at the risk of altering the connectivity
              structure and topological hub distributions when higher densities graphs
              are employed (e.g., > 6%). Group-level analysis correction for motion was
              once again found to be a crucial step. Finally, similar to recent work, we
              found a constellation of findings suggestive of the possibility that some
              of the motion-relationships detected may reflect neural or trait signatures
              of motion, rather than simply motion-induced artifact. }
