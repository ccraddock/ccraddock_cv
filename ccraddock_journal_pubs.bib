    abstract = {Abstract In 2011, the “ADHD-200 Global Competition” was held with the aim of identifying biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural \{MRI\} (s-MRI) data collected on 973 individuals. Statisticians and computer scientists were potentially the most qualified for the machine learning aspect of the competition, but generally lacked the specialized skills to implement the necessary steps of data preparation for rs-fMRI. Realizing this barrier to entry, the Neuro Bureau prospectively collaborated with all competitors by preprocessing the data and sharing these results at the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) (http://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=383). This “ADHD-200 Preprocessed” release included multiple analytical pipelines to cater to different philosophies of data analysis. The processed derivatives included denoised and registered 4D fMRI volumes, regional time series extracted from brain parcellations, maps of 10 intrinsic connectivity networks, fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity, along with grey matter density maps. The data was used by several teams who competed in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, including the winning entry by a group of biostaticians. To the best of our knowledge, the ADHD-200 Preprocessed release was the first large public resource of preprocessed resting-state fMRI and structural \{MRI\} data, and remains to this day the only resource featuring a battery of alternative processing paths.},

    abstract = {Abstract This data descriptor describes a repository of openly shared data from an experiment to assess inter-individual differences in default mode network (DMN) activity. This repository includes cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Multi Source Interference Task, to assess \{DMN\} deactivation, the Moral Dilemma Task, to assess \{DMN\} activation, a resting state fMRI scan, and a \{DMN\} neurofeedback paradigm, to assess \{DMN\} modulation, along with accompanying behavioral and cognitive measures. We report technical validation from n=125 participants of the final targeted sample of 180 participants. Each session includes acquisition of one whole-brain anatomical scan and whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans, acquired during the aforementioned tasks and resting state. The data includes several self-report measures related to perseverative thinking, emotion regulation, and imaginative processes, along with a behavioral measure of rapid visual information processing. Technical validation of the data confirms that the tasks deactivate and activate the \{DMN\} as expected. Group level analysis of the neurofeedback data indicates that the participants are able to modulate their \{DMN\} with considerable inter-subject variability. Preliminary analysis of behavioral responses and specifically self-reported sleep indicate that as many as 73 participants may need to be excluded from an analysis depending on the hypothesis being tested. The present data are linked to the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute, Rockland Sample and builds on the comprehensive neuroimaging and deep phenotyping available therein. As limited information is presently available about individual differences in the capacity to directly modulate the default mode network, these data provide a unique opportunity to examine \{DMN\} modulation ability in relation to numerous phenotypic characteristics.},

    abstract = {Abstract Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (R-fMRI) holds the promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted neuropathologies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large (N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full \{ABIDE\} data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.},

    abstract = {Author summary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive way to measure human brain structure and activity that has been used for over 25 years. There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.},

    abstract = {Abstract The disparity between the chronological age of an individual and their brain-age measured based on biological information has the potential to offer clinically relevant biomarkers of neurological syndromes that emerge late in the lifespan. While prior brain-age prediction studies have relied exclusively on either structural or functional brain data, here we investigate how multimodal brain-imaging data improves age prediction. Using cortical anatomy and whole-brain functional connectivity on a large adult lifespan sample (N=2354, age 19–82), we found that multimodal data improves brain-based age prediction, resulting in a mean absolute prediction error of 4.29 years. Furthermore, we found that the discrepancy between predicted age and chronological age captures cognitive impairment. Importantly, the brain-age measure was robust to confounding effects: head motion did not drive brain-based age prediction and our models generalized reasonably to an independent dataset acquired at a different site (N=475). Generalization performance was increased by training models on a larger and more heterogeneous dataset. The robustness of multimodal brain-age prediction to confounds, generalizability across sites, and sensitivity to clinically-relevant impairments, suggests promising future application to the early prediction of neurocognitive disorders.},

    abstract = {AbstractBackground Data-driven approaches can capture behavioral and biological variation currently unaccounted for by contemporary diagnostic categories, thereby enhancing the ability of neurobiological studies to characterize brain-behavior relationships. Methods A community-ascertained sample of individuals (N = 347, 18–59 years of age) completed a battery of behavioral measures, psychiatric assessment, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a cross-sectional design. Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid hierarchical clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify nested groups. Adjacent groups were compared via independent samples t tests and chi-square tests of factor scores, syndrome scores, and psychiatric prevalence. Multivariate distance matrix regression examined functional connectome differences between adjacent groups. Results Reduction yielded six factors, which explained 77.8% and 65.4% of the variance in exploratory and constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid hierarchical clustering of these six factors identified two, four, and eight nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level, groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups; internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and limbic networks. Conclusions Data-driven approaches for identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to dysfunction, not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but also captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among healthy individuals.},

    abstract = {Abstract Naturalistic viewing paradigms such as movies have been shown to reduce participant head motion and improve arousal during fMRI scanning relative to task-free rest, and have been used to study both functional connectivity and stimulus-evoked BOLD-signal changes. These task-based hemodynamic changes are synchronized across subjects and involve large areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize variability in BOLD-signal based functional connectivity (FC) across 2 distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=31 healthy adults, 2 scan sessions each). We found that movies have higher within- and between-subject correlations in cluster-wise \{FC\} relative to rest. The anatomical distribution of inter-individual variability was similar across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an unsupervised test-retest matching algorithm that identifies individual subjects from within a group based on \{FC\} patterns, quantifying the accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. The movies and resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on \{FC\} matrices, with accuracies between 61% and 100%. Overall, pairings involving movies outperformed rest, and the social, faster-paced movie attained 100% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan duration, and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved across conditions, and the pattern of movies&gt;rest was preserved. These results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the detection of \{FC\} patterns that are unique at the individual level.},

    abstract = {Brain iron plays key roles in catecholaminergic neurotransmitter synthesis and early life brain development. It is also central to cellular energetics and neurotransmitter metabolism throughout the lifespan. Disturbances in brain iron have been implicated in a growing number of psychiatric and late-life neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, brain iron accumulations are thought to play a deleterious role in neuroinflammatory processes in later life. Despite its importance, the role of brain iron in development, aging, and psychiatric disorders remains comparatively understudied. This is partly due to technical challenges inherent in implementation and analysis of formal iron imaging protocols and practical constraints on scan session durations. Here, we introduce a method to estimate relative brain iron concentrations that is 1) computationally simple, 2) shows excellent correspondence with formal iron imaging in-vivo, 3) replicates clinically-relevant findings from formal iron imaging, 4) yields novel insights into brain iron and cognition across the lifespan, and 5) leverages a widely available and frequently shared brain imaging modality: functional MRI. The computationally simple nature of the measure, coupled with the availability of fMRI datasets across the lifespan and disorders, has the potential to transform our understanding of the complex and critical relationship between iron and brain health.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a procedure to find differential edges between 2 graphs from high-dimensional data. We estimate 2 matrices of partial correlations and their differences by solving a penalized regression problem. We assume sparsity only on differences between 2 graphs, not graphs themselves. Thus, we impose an ℓ2 penalty on partial correlations and an ℓ1 penalty on their differences in the penalized regression problem. We apply the proposed procedure in finding differential functional connectivity between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients.},

abstract = "Contemporary cognitive neuroscience recognises unconstrained processing varies across individuals, describing variation in meaningful attributes, such as intelligence. It may also have links to patterns of on-going experience. This study examined whether dimensions of population variation in different modes of unconstrained processing can be described by the associations between patterns of neural activity and self-reports of experience during the same period. We selected 258 individuals from a publicly available data set who had measures of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and self-reports of experience during the scan. We used machine learning to determine patterns of association between the neural and self-reported data, finding variation along four dimensions. ‘Purposeful’ experiences were associated with lower connectivity - in particular default mode and limbic networks were less correlated with attention and sensorimotor networks. ‘Emotional’ experiences were associated with higher connectivity, especially between limbic and ventral attention networks. Experiences focused on themes of ‘personal importance’ were associated with reduced functional connectivity within attention and control systems. Finally, visual experiences were associated with stronger connectivity between visual and other networks, in particular the limbic system. Some of these patterns had contrasting links with cognitive function as assessed in a separate laboratory session - purposeful thinking was linked to greater intelligence and better abstract reasoning, while a focus on personal importance had the opposite relationship. Together these findings are consistent with an emerging literature on unconstrained states and also underlines that these states are heterogeneous, with distinct modes of population variation reflecting the interplay of different large-scale networks.",

However, the complexity and setup requirements of current in-scanner eye tracking solutions can preclude many researchers from accessing such information. Predictive eye estimation regression (PEER) is a previously developed support vector regression-based method for retrospectively estimating eye gaze from the fMRI signal in the eye’s orbit using a 1.5-min calibration scan. Here, we provide confirmatory validation of the PEER method’s ability to infer eye gaze on a TR-by-TR basis during movie viewing, using simultaneously acquired eye tracking data in five individuals (median angular deviation \\&lt; 2°). Then, we examine variations in the predictive validity of PEER models across individuals in a subset of data (n = 448) from the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network Biobank, identifying head motion as a primary determinant. Finally, we accurately classify which of the two movies is being watched based on the predicted eye gaze patterns (area under the curve = 0.90 ± 0.02) and map the neural correlates of eye movements derived from PEER. PEER is a freely available and easy-to-use tool for determining eye fixations during naturalistic viewing.}",

    abstract = {Neurofeedback training has been shown to influence behavior in healthy participants as well as to alleviate clinical symptoms in neurological, psychosomatic, and psychiatric patient populations. However, many real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies report large interindividual differences in learning success. The factors that cause this vast variability between participants remain unknown and their identification could enhance treatment success. Thus, here we employed a meta-analytic approach including data from 24 different neurofeedback studies with a total of 401 participants, including 140 patients, to determine whether levels of activity in target brain regions during pre-training functional localizer or no-feedback runs (i.e., self-regulation in the absence of neurofeedback) could predict neurofeedback learning success. We observed a slightly positive correlation between pre-training activity levels during a functional localizer run and neurofeedback learning success, but we were not able to identify common brain-based success predictors across our diverse cohort of studies. Therefore, advances need to be made in finding robust models and measures of general neurofeedback learning, and in increasing the current study database to allow for investigating further factors that might influence neurofeedback learning.},

    abstract = {Analyzing resting state fMRI data is difficult due to a weak signal and several noise sources. Head motion is also a major problem and it is common to apply motion scrubbing, i.e. to remove time points where a subject has moved more than some pre-defined motion threshold. A problem arises if one cohort on average moves more than another, since the remaining temporal degrees of freedom are then different for the two groups. The effect of this is that the uncertainty of the functional connectivity estimates (e.g. Pearson correlations) are different for the two groups, but this is seldom modelled in resting state fMRI. We demonstrate that group differences in motion scrubbing can result in inflated false positives, depending on how the temporal auto correlation is modelled when performing the Fisher r-to-z transform.},

    abstract = {Reproducibility, the ability to replicate analytical findings, is a prerequisite for both scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a reproducibility crisis, in which many investigations fail to replicate. Although many believe that these failings are due to misunderstanding or misapplication of statistical inference (e.g., p-values or the dichotomization of {\textquotedblleft}statistically significant{\textquotedblright}), we believe the shortcomings arise much earlier in the data science workflow, at the level of measurement, including data acquisition and reconstruction. A key to reproducibility is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) are similar to one another, while they are dissimilar from other items. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) quantifies reproducibility in this way, but only for univariate (one dimensional) Gaussian data. In contrast, big data is multivariate (high-dimensional), non-Gaussian, and often non-Euclidean (including text, images, speech, and networks), rendering ICC inadequate. We propose a novel statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the degree to which individual samples are discriminable from one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. We then introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability. We prove that optimizing discriminability yields an improved ability to use the data for subsequent inference tasks, without specifying the inference task a priori. We then apply this approach to a brain imaging dataset built by the {\textquotedblleft}Consortium for Reliability and reproducibility{\textquotedblright} which consists of 28 disparate magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Optimizing discriminability improves performance on multiple subsequent inference tasks, despite that they were not considered in the optimization. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the reproducibility crisis.},
